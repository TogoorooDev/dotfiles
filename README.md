# dotfiles
A repo with my dotfiles

## Background
I used dwm, mksh, and st. The dotfiles will predominatly be about those programs. Suckless stuff in in the source directory
There are some old files from programs I do not use anymore, they are in there but I likely will not change them in a long time if ever. This can be good or bad.
