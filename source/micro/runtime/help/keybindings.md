# Keybindings

Micro has a plethora of hotkeys that make it easy and powerful to use and all
hotkeys are fully customizable to your liking.

Custom keybindings are stored internally in micro if changed with the `> bind`
command or can also be added in the file `~/.config/micro/bindings.json` as
discussed below. For a list of the default keybindings in the json format used
by micro, please see the end of this file. For a more user-friendly list with
explanations of what the default hotkeys are and what they do, please see
`> help defaultkeys` (a json formatted list of default keys is included
at the end of this document).

If `~/.config/micro/bindings.json` does not exist, you can simply create it.
Micro will know what to do with it.

You can use the alt keys + arrows to move word by word. Ctrl left and right
move the cursor to the start and end of the line, and ctrl up and down move the
cursor the start and end of the buffer.

You can hold shift with all of these movement actions to select while moving.

## Rebinding keys

The bindings may be rebound using the `~/.config/micro/bindings.json` file.
Each key is bound to an action.

For example, to bind `Ctrl-y` to undo and `Ctrl-z` to redo, you could put the
following in the `bindings.json` file.

```json
{
	"Ctrl-y": "Undo",
	"Ctrl-z": "Redo"
}
```

**Note:** The syntax `<Modifier><key>` is equivalent to `<Modifier>-<key>`. In
addition, Ctrl-Shift bindings are not supported by terminals, and are the same
as simply Ctrl bindings. This means that `CtrlG`, `Ctrl-G`, and `Ctrl-g` all
mean the same thing. However, for Alt this is not the case: `AltG` and `Alt-G`
mean `Alt-Shift-g`, while `Alt-g` does not require the Shift modifier.

In addition to editing your `~/.config/micro/bindings.json`, you can run
`>bind <keycombo> <action>` For a list of bindable actions, see below.

You can also chain commands when rebinding. For example, if you want Alt-s to
save and quit you can bind it like so:

```json
{
    "Alt-s": "Save,Quit"
}
```

Each action will return a success flag. Actions can be chained such that
the chain only continues when there are successes, or failures, or either.
The `,` separator will always chain to the next action. The `|` separator
will abort the chain if the action preceding it succeeds, and the `&` will
abort the chain if the action preceding it fails. For example, in the default
bindings, tab is bound as

```
"Tab": "Autocomplete|IndentSelection|InsertTab"
```

This means that if the `Autocomplete` action is successful, the chain will
abort. Otherwise, it will try `IndentSelection`, and if that fails too, it
will execute `InsertTab`.

## Binding commands

You can also bind a key to execute a command in command mode (see 
`help commands`). Simply prepend the binding with `command:`. For example:

```json
{
    "Alt-p": "command:pwd"
}
```

**Note for macOS**: By default, macOS terminals do not forward alt events and
instead insert unicode characters. To fix this, do the following:

* iTerm2: select `Esc+` for `Left Option Key` in `Preferences->Profiles->Keys`.
* Terminal.app: Enable `Use Option key as Meta key` in `Preferences->Profiles->Keyboard`.

Now when you press `Alt-p` the `pwd` command will be executed which will show
your working directory in the infobar.

You can also bind an "editable" command with `command-edit:`. This means that 
micro won't immediately execute the command when you press the binding, but
instead just place the string in the infobar in command mode. For example, 
you could rebind `Ctrl-g` to `> help`:

```json
{
    "Ctrl-g": "command-edit:help "
}
```

Now when you press `Ctrl-g`, `help` will appear in the command bar and your
cursor will be placed after it (note the space in the json that controls the
cursor placement).

## Binding raw escape sequences

Only read this section if you are interested in binding keys that aren't on the 
list of supported keys for binding.

One of the drawbacks of using a terminal-based editor is that the editor must
get all of its information about key events through the terminal. The terminal
sends these events in the form of escape sequences often (but not always)
starting with `0x1b`. 

For example, if micro reads `\x1b[1;5D`, on most terminals this will mean the
user pressed CtrlLeft.

For many key chords though, the terminal won't send any escape code or will
send an escape code already in use. For example for `CtrlBackspace`, my
terminal sends `\u007f` (note this doesn't start with `0x1b`), which it also
sends for `Backspace` meaning micro can't bind `CtrlBackspace`.

However, some terminals do allow you to bind keys to send specific escape
sequences you define. Then from micro you can directly bind those escape
sequences to actions. For example, to bind `CtrlBackspace` you can instruct
your terminal to send `\x1bctrlback` and then bind it in `bindings.json`:

```json
{
    "\u001bctrlback": "DeleteWordLeft"
}
```

Here are some instructions for sending raw escapes in different terminals

### iTerm2

In iTerm2, you can do this in  `Preferences->Profiles->Keys` then click the
`+`, input your keybinding, and for the `Action` select `Send Escape Sequence`.
For the above example your would type `ctrlback` into the box (the `\x1b`) is
automatically sent by iTerm2.

### Linux using loadkeys

You can do this in linux using the loadkeys program.

## Unbinding keys

It is also possible to disable any of the default key bindings by use of the 
`None` action in the user's `bindings.json` file.

## Bindable actions and bindable keys

# Default keybinding configuration.

A select few keybindings are different on MacOS compared to other
operating systems. This is because different OSes have different
conventions for text editing defaults.

}
```

## Pane type bindings

Keybindings can be specified for different pane types as well. For example, to
make a binding that only affects the command bar, use the `command` subgroup:

```
{
    "command": {
        "Ctrl-w": "WordLeft"
    }
}
```

The possible pane types are `buffer` (normal buffer), `command` (command bar),
and `terminal` (terminal pane). The defaults for the command and terminal panes
are given below:

```
{
    "terminal": {
        "<Ctrl-q><Ctrl-q>": "Exit",
        "<Ctrl-e><Ctrl-e>": "CommandMode",
        "<Ctrl-w><Ctrl-w>": "NextSplit"
    },

    "command": {
        "Up":             "HistoryUp",
        "Down":           "HistoryDown",
        "Right":          "CursorRight",
        "Left":           "CursorLeft",
        "ShiftUp":        "SelectUp",
        "ShiftDown":      "SelectDown",
        "ShiftLeft":      "SelectLeft",
        "ShiftRight":     "SelectRight",
        "AltLeft":        "StartOfTextToggle",
        "AltRight":       "EndOfLine",
        "AltUp":          "CursorStart",
        "AltDown":        "CursorEnd",
        "AltShiftRight":  "SelectWordRight",
        "AltShiftLeft":   "SelectWordLeft",

        "CtrlRight":      "WordRight",
        "CtrlShiftLeft":  "SelectToStartOfTextToggle",
        "ShiftHome":      "SelectToStartOfTextToggle",

        "OldBackspace":   "Backspace",
        "Alt-CtrlH":      "DeleteWordLeft",
        "Alt-Backspace":  "DeleteWordLeft",
        "Tab":            "CommandComplete",
        "Backtab":        "CycleAutocompleteBack",
        "Ctrl-z":         "Undo",
        "Ctrl-y":         "Redo",
        "Ctrl-c":         "CopyLine|Copy",
        "Ctrl-x":         "Cut",
        "Ctrl-k":         "CutLine",
        "Ctrl-v":         "Paste",
        "Home":           "StartOfTextToggle",
        "End":            "EndOfLine",
        "CtrlHome":       "CursorStart",
        "CtrlEnd":        "CursorEnd",
        "Delete":         "Delete",
        "Ctrl-q":         "AbortCommand",
        "Ctrl-e":         "EndOfLine",
        "Ctrl-a":         "StartOfLine",
        "Ctrl-w":         "DeleteWordLeft",
        "Insert":         "ToggleOverwriteMode",
        "Ctrl-b":         "WordLeft",
        "Ctrl-f":         "WordRight",
        "Ctrl-d":         "DeleteWordLeft",
        "Ctrl-m":         "ExecuteCommand",
        "Ctrl-n":         "HistoryDown",
        "Ctrl-p":         "HistoryUp",

        "MouseLeft":      "MousePress",
        "MouseMiddle":    "PastePrimary"
    }
}
```

## Final notes

Note: On some old terminal emulators and on Windows machines, `Ctrl-h` should be
used for backspace.

Additionally, alt keys can be bound by using `Alt-key`. For example `Alt-a` or
`Alt-Up`. Micro supports an optional `-` between modifiers like `Alt` and 
`Ctrl` so `Alt-a` could be rewritten as `Alta` (case matters for alt bindings).
This is why in the default keybindings you can see `AltShiftLeft` instead of
`Alt-ShiftLeft` (they are equivalent).

Please note that terminal emulators are strange applications and micro only
receives key events that the terminal decides to send. Some terminal emulators
may not send certain events even if this document says micro can receive the
event. To see exactly what micro receives from the terminal when you press a
key, run the `> raw` command.
