attachtop
=========

Description
-----------
New client attaches below the last master/on top of the stack.

Behavior feels very intuitive as it doesn't disrupt existing masters
no matter the amount of them, it only pushes the clients in stack
down. In case of `nmaster = 1` feels like [attachaside](../attachaside/)

Is included in [attachdirection](../attachdirection/)
