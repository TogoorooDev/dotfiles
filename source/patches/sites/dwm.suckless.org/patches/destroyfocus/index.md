destroyfocus
============

Description
-----------
Focus client under mouse on DestroyNotify.

The client selected after destroy is somewhat deterministic, but not trivial to
reason about for a user, especially for long-term windows. As such, apply the
focus to whichever window the mouse ends up being on top of on destroy.
