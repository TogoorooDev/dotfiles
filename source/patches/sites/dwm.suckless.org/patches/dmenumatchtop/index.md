dmenumatchtop
=============

Description
-----------
Updates the position of dmenu to match that of `topbar`. If `topbar` is `0`,
then dmenu will appear at the bottom, and if `topbar` is `1`, dmenu will appear
at the top.

The patch modifies `config.def.h`. Make sure to update `config.h` accordingly,
if the file exists.
