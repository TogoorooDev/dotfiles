dynamicscratchpads
==================

Description
-----------
More i3-like behaviour. Allows for the management of scratchpad windows dynamically. You can hide, show (cycle through) and remove any window from scratchpad without specifying them in the config.h.

There are just three keybindings to manage the scratchpad:
* Move selected window to scratchpad
* Remove selected window from scratchpad
* Restore sequential window from scratchpad

You also can create rules to start specific windows in scratchpad.

Doesn't conflict with the [namedscratchpads](../namedscratchpads/) patch.
