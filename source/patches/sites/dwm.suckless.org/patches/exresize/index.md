exresize
========

Description
-----------
This allows the user to change size and placement of floating windows using
only the keyboard. It also allows for temporary vertical and horizontal
extension of windows similar to other WMs fill command. This patch is inspired
by [maximize](../maximize/) and [moveresize](../moveresize/) but fixes a lot of
problems I had with those patches. It also includes the functionality of [save
floats](../save_floats/) judging by it's description.
