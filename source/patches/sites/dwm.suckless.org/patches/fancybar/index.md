fancybar
========

Description
-----------
This patch provides a status bar that shows the titles of all visible windows
(as opposed to showing just the selected one). When the titles don't completely
fit, they're cropped. The title of the selected window is inverted.

This patch was inspired by the decorated tabbed layout of Xmonad.
