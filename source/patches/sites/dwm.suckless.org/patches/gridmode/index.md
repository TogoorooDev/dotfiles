gridmode
========

Description
-----------
This patch adds an extra layout mode to dwm called `grid` in which the windows
are arranged in a grid of equal sizes. It comes in very handy, especially with
tools that operate on multiple windows at once; e.g. Cluster SSH.

The patch would look a lot uglier without Jukka Salmi's constant help.
Thanks Jukka :-)
