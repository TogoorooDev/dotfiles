hide vacant tags
================

Description
-----------
This patch prevents dwm from drawing tags with no clients (i.e. vacant) on the
bar.

It also makes sure that pressing a tag on the bar behaves accordingly by not
reserving reactive regions on the bar for vacant tags.

It also stops drawing empty rectangles on the bar for non-vacant tags as there
is no need anymore to distinguish vacant tags and it offers a more visible
contrast than if there were filled/empty rectangles.
