gridmode
========

Description
-----------
This patch adds an extra layout mode to dwm called `grid` in which the windows
are arranged in a grid of windows of equal sizes. It comes very in handy
especially with tools that operate on multiple windows at once such Cluster
SSH.

Usage
-----
Add a grid-symbol to your `config.h` file.

patch to make dwm more colourful :D)

The patch would look a lot uglier without Jukka Salmi's constant help. Thanks
