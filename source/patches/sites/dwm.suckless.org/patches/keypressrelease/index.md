keypressrelease
===============

Description
-----------
This patch lets you specify whether a key binding should be executed at the
_KeyPress_ or _KeyRelease_ event. Executing on _KeyRelease_ fixes bugs such as
`scrot -s` [failing to execute from a key binding](//lists.suckless.org/dev/1108/9185.html)
due to keys not being released in time.

Note that the new parameter must be added to all non-standard key bindings
manually after patching.

Usage
-----
A working `scrot -s` key binding:

	{ KeyRelease, 0,                XK_Print,  spawn,          SHCMD("scrot -s") },

Or to only display the bar while the toggle key is held down (requires that it
is hidden to start with), add:

    { KeyRelease, MODKEY,           XK_b,      togglebar,      {0} },

Alternatives
------------

An alternative is to put a tiny sleep right before executing scrot.

    { ControlMask,                  XK_Print,  spawn,          SHCMD("sleep 0.2; scrot -s") },
