killunsel
=========

Description
-----------
Kills all visible clients that are unselected. That is, after running
`killunsel`, only the selected client will remain. The rest will not only be
not visible, but they will have been killed.

This is essentially equivalent in idea to :tabonly (albeit per-client, not
per-"tab") in vim.
