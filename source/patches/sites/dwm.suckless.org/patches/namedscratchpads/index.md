namedscratchpads
================

Description
-----------
Allows for the creation of multiple scratchpad windows, each assigned to different keybinds.

On pressing the keybind the window will either:
* Spawn based on the given command, if it's not already running
* Toggle visibility of the window

A new field in the rules array is added to associate the command with the corresponding rule.

Works well with [floatrules](../floatrules/) for window positioning.
