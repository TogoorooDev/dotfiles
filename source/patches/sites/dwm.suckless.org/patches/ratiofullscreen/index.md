ratiofullscreen
===============

Description
-----------
Toggle fullscreen for a window while saving its ratio.

Space left uncovered by a window may be set to be black or left
transparent.

The patch is intended to be used with old games which have miniscule
window sizes and don't handle fullscreen correctly themselves.

Smartborders patch (its modified resizeclient function) is a dependency
of this patch.
