statuspadding
=============

Description
-----------
This makes the amount of horizontal and vertical padding in the status bar
into configurable options.

This padding is also applied to StatusText in an equal manner, as opposed to
just right padding.

The configurable options in config.def.h are:

horizpadbar

vertpadbar

The defaults in config.def.h leave dwm with the same appearance as pre-patch
except StatusText now has left padding in addition to right padding.
