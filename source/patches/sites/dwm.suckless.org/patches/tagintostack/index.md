tagintostack
============

Description
-----------
`tagintostack` new clients attach into the stack area when you toggle a new tag
into view. This means your master area will remain unchanged when toggling
views.

* the `allmaster` patch will cause all clients in the master area to be left
  alone
* the `onemaster` patch will cause the first client in the master area to be left
  alone (this is a much simpler piece of code)
