custom urgent border
====================

Description
-----------
This patch makes borders of "urgent" windows a different color. By default it
is bright red. Use config.h item "urgbordercolor" to change it.

An alternative patch which provides a minimal urgent border utilizing the
existing features to provide a feature parity to the urgent tags, using the
same foreground color as the urgent tags which they inverted.
