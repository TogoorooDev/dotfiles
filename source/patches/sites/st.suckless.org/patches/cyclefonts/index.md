cyclefonts
==========

Description
-----------
This patch adds a keybinding that lets you cycle between multiple different
fonts. Define `fonts` in your `config.def.h` as an array instead of `font`.

Notes
-----
* `currentfont` controls which font is loaded at the start, and must not exceed
  the size of the fonts array.
