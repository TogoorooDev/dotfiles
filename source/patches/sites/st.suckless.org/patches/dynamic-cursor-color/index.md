![](dynamic-cursor-color.png)

Description
-----------
Swaps the colors of your cursor and the character you're currently on (much like alacritty). Some say the effect is very appealing:)

Notes
-----

Might be incomplete - I'm new and improvements are very welcome!

- Might have some edge cases where it doesn't work properly
- Performance degradation considerations? More testing & feedback needed
