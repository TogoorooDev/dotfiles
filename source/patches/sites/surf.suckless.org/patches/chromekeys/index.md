chrome keys
===========

Description
-----------

This patch offers alternative keybindings that are both more Vim-like
and more Chrome-like. Specifically, mod-{h,j,k,l} (small jump) and
mod-{b,f} (page jump) are mapped to navigation within the current
window, mod-o and mod-i navigate the history (as they do in Vim),
mod-u is view source, and mod-shift-u opens the inspector.
