short-title
=========

Description
-----------

This provides a patch to improve readability of the title when using surf with tabbed by allowing the user to hide status information form the title of surf. In particular it removes the Indicators of Operation and Indicators of Web Page from the title. Refer the man page for their definition.

Either pass a `-E [1|0]` as a command line argument to use extended/short extended title respectively or use `MOD + Shift + e` to toggle between the two.
