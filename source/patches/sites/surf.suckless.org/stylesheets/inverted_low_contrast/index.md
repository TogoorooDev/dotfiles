Inverted low contrast style
===========================

Filter based solutions for those who like it dark (mostly, on dark sites
effect is opposite), but don't like acid-trippy images and colors. Works
reasonably smooth, unless there are lots of images.

css

    html, img { -webkit-filter: invert(95%) hue-rotate(180deg); }
