Bidirectional Text
==================
This patch adds proper support for Right-To-Left languages, such as Hebrew, Arabic, and Farsi.

Texts combining both RTL and LTR languages are displayed correctly.
This is achieved using the GNU FriBiDi library, which is an additional dependency for this patch.
