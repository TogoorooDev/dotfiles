Multiple selection
==================

Description
-----------
Without this patch when you press `<Control-Enter>` dmenu just outputs current item and you can't undo that.
But with this patch dmenu will output all selected items only on exit. And you can also deselect any selected item.

`dmenu_run.sh` is a `dmenu_run` replacement that supports multiple selection patch.
