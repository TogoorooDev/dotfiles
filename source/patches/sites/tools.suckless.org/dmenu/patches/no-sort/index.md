no sort
=======

Description
-----------

Adds the `-S` option to disable sorting menu items after matching. Useful, for example, when menu items are sorted by their frequency of use (using an external cache) and the most frequently selected items should always appear first regardless of how they were exact, prefix, or substring matches.
