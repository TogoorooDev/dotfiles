pipeout
=======

Description
-----------
This patch allows the selected text to be piped back out with dmenu. This is
useful if you want to display the output of a command on the screen. Only text
starting with the character '#' is piped out by default.

Configuration
-------------
Set the variable 'startpipe' in config.h to any character.
