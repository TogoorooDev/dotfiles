Progress Bar
============

Description
-----------
This patch introduces a progress bar at the very bottom of non-image slides.
Similar to the slide numbers patch, it may be useful for an audience to know
how much more of a presentation they have to endure. One way of measuring this
is to add a bar to the slides which indicate the presenter's progress based on
slide count.
