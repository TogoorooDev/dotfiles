hide commands
=============

Description
-----------
This patch lets you hide IRC messages such as JOIN/QUIT. You can use the sic
command 'h' to specify what messages are hidden. Example: :h JOIN,QUIT

Now all JOIN and QUIT messages will not be displayed. The delimiter is
unimportant (use what you like or nothing at all)

Use the command without arguments to stop hiding any messages.
