Control Clear
=============

Description
-----------
Adds an additional configuration parameter, controlkeyclear. When set to 1,
slock will no longer change to the failure color if a control key is pressed
while the buffer is empty. This is useful if, for example, you wake your
monitor up by pressing a control key and don't want to spoil the detection of
failed unlocking attempts.
