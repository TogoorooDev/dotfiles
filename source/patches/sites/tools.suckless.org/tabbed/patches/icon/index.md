Icon
====

Description
-----------
This patch gives tabbed an icon. This icon is the currently selected tab's icon.  
If the selected tab has no icon (or no tab is selected), use a (admittedly ugly) default icon.

This patch supports both the new EWMH (\_NET\_WM\_ICON) and  
legacy ICCCM (WM\_ICON) ways of setting a window's icon.
