==========

Description
-----------
This patch adds the ability to configure tabbed via Xresources.  At startup, tabbed
will read and apply the resources named in the `resources[]` array in config.h.

Most of the code has been copied from the [st patch of the same name](https://st.suckless.org/patches/xresources).
