Pixz (pronounced 'pixie') is a parallel, indexing version of XZ.

The existing XZ Utils provide great compression in the .xz file
format, but they produce just one big block of compressed data.
Pixz instead produces a collection of smaller blocks which makes
random access to the original data possible. This is especially
useful for large tarballs.
