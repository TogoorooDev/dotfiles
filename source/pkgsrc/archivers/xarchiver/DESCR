Desktop Environment independent archiver front end. All common archive
formats are supported, deb and RPM packages are handled without their package
managers being installed. Xarchiver only depends on the GTK+ libraries and
utilizes various (un)compressor/(un)archiver command line programs at runtime.
Installation of xdg-utils is optional but installing it will allow Xarchiver
to support opening more file types directly from inside an archive.
