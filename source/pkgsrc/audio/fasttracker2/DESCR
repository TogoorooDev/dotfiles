fasttracker2 is a Fasttracker II clone in C using SDL 2.

fasttracker2 is a music tracker (a type of music sequencer software)
for creating and playing back tracker music.

This clone is meant for computers with a modern GPU and CPU (about
2007 or newer recommended).  It's also designed for 60Hz refresh
rates, so it can act choppy if you're above 60Hz.
