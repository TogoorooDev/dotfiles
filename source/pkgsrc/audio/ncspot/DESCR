ncurses Spotify client written in Rust using librespot. It is heavily inspired
by ncurses MPD clients, such as ncmpc.  My motivation was to provide a simple
and resource friendly alternative to the official client as well as to support
platforms that currently don't have a Spotify client, such as the *BSDs.

Note: ncspot requires a Spotify premium account.
