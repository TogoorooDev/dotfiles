ossrecord records audio in Microsoft RIFF (wav) format.

ossplay plays raw PCM, Microsoft RIFF (.wav), Sun ULaw (.au), Mac AIFF (.aif)
and other types of audio files. By default the application will try to
determine the audio file's format and play audio based on the stored
inforation about sample format, number of channels and sampling rate.

NOTE: On NetBSD, use audioplay(1) and audiorecord(1) instead.
This package primarily exists to test OSSv4 compatibility.
