Racon is intended as a standalone consensus module to correct raw
contigs generated by rapid assembly methods which do not include a
consensus step. The goal of Racon is to generate genomic consensus
which is of similar or better quality compared to the output generated
by assembly methods which employ both error correction and consensus
steps, while providing a speedup of several times compared to those
methods. It supports data produced by both Pacific Biosciences and
Oxford Nanopore Technologies.

Racon can be used as a polishing tool after the assembly with either
Illumina data or data produced by third generation of sequencing. The
type of data inputed is automatically detected.
