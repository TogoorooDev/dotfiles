Anope is an open source set of IRC Services. It is highly modular,
with a vast number of configurable parameters, and is the most used
IRC services package. There are also many modules on the modsite
to add additional features. It supports many modern IRCds, including
InspIRCd, UnrealIRCd, and ircd-hybrid.
