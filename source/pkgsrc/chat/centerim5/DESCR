CenterIM is a text-mode multi-protocol instant messaging client
for Linux, *BSD, Solaris and other Unices. The program supports
most of widely used IM protocols, including AIM, ICQ, IRC, QQ,
Skype, XMPP (Jabber).

CenterIM is a powerful communication tool that can be used through
SSH, without the need for VNC/Remote Desktop. CenterIM started as
a fork of CenterICQ.

Development has ceased on CenterIM4 in favor of CenterIM5, which
is a ground up rewrite and uses the libpurple library as a
communication backend.
