ircd-hybrid is now installed.  Do note some programs have changed
names to more readily reflect their ircd-hybrid function;
make sure to prefix them with "ircd-hybrid":

    mkpasswd -> ircd-hybrid-mkpasswd

To run ircd-hybrid you will need to create:

    ${PREFIX}/etc/ircd-hybrid/ircd.conf

An example configuration can be found at
${PREFIX}/share/doc/ircd-hybrid/doc/reference.conf

The documentation can be found at ${PREFIX}/share/doc/ircd-hybrid.
