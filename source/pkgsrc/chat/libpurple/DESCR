An instant messaging backend for Windows, Linux, BSD, and other Unixes.

You can talk to your friends using Jabber/XMPP, Bonjour, Gadu-Gadu, IRC,
Novell GroupWise Messenger, Lotus Sametime, SILC, SIMPLE, and Zephyr.

This library requires a frontend to be useful, such as the graphical user
interface Pidgin, or the console interface Finch.
