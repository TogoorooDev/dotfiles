Synapse is a reference "homeserver" implementation of Matrix from the core
development team at matrix.org, written in Python/Twisted.  It is intended to
showcase the concept of Matrix and let folks see the spec in the context of a
codebase and let you run your own homeserver and generally help bootstrap the
ecosystem.
