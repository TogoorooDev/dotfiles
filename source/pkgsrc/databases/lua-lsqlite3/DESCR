lsqlite3 is a thin wrapper around the public domain SQLite3 database engine.

The lsqlite3 module supports the creation and manipulation of SQLite3
databases.

After a require('lsqlite3') the exported functions are called with prefix
sqlite3.  However, most sqlite3 functions are called via an object-oriented
interface to either database or SQL statement objects.
