wal2json is an output plugin for logical decoding. It means that the plugin
have access to tuples produced by INSERT and UPDATE. Also, UPDATE/DELETE old
row versions can be accessed depending on the configured replica identity.
Changes can be consumed using the streaming protocol (logical replication
slots) or by a special SQL API.

format version 1 produces a JSON object per transaction. All of the new/old
tuples are available in the JSON object. Also, there are options to include
properties such as transaction timestamp, schema-qualified, data types, and
transaction ids.

format version 2 produces a JSON object per tuple. Optional JSON object for
beginning and end of transaction. Also, there are a variety of options to
include properties.
