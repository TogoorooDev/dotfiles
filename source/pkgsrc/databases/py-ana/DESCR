ANA is a project to provide easy distributed data storage for stuff.
It provides every object with a UUID and, when pickled, will first serialize
the object's state to a central location and then "pickle" the object into just
its UUID. This is really handy when you have to distribute objects in some
distributed system, and you'd rather not pickle the whole object every time you
need to send it.

ANA violates some of pickle's assumptions.
Users of pickle often have an implicit assumption that the objects they
unpickle will be different (identity-wise) than the objects that they pickle.
This is not the case with ANA; in fact, it has an object cache specifically to
avoid this. Furthermore, depending on the mode of operation, ANA might store
the objects centrally, by UUID, where it will be accessed by other instances of
ANA. Because of these things, the objects serialized with ANA should be
immutable, if you know what's good for you.
