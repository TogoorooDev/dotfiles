kb is a text-oriented minimalist command line knowledge base manager.
kb can be considered a quick note collection and access tool oriented
toward software developers, penetration testers, hackers, students
or whoever has to collect and organize notes in a clean way. Although
kb is mainly targeted on text-based note collection, it supports
non-text files as well (e.g., images, pdf, videos and others).

The project was born from the frustration of trying to find a good
way to quickly access my notes, procedures, cheatsheets and lists
(e.g., payloads) but at the same time, keeping them organized. This
is particularly useful for any kind of student. I use it in the
context of penetration testing to organize pentesting procedures,
cheatsheets, payloads, guides and notes.
