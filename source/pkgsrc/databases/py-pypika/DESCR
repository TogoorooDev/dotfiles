PyPika is a Python API for building SQL queries. The motivation behind PyPika
is to provide a simple interface for building SQL queries without limiting the
flexibility of handwritten SQL. Designed with data analysis in mind, PyPika
leverages the builder design pattern to construct queries to avoid messy string
formatting and concatenation. It is also easily extended to take full advantage
of specific features of SQL database vendors.
