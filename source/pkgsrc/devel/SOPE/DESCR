SOPE stands for "SKYRiX Object Publishing Environment" and is a
framework for mapping dynamic objects into the HTTP infrastructure,
that is, the web. A lot of ideas in SOPE are actually inspired by
ZOPE (the Z Object Publishing Environment), but the implementation
and details are quite different.

This is an old version still maintained by upstream.
