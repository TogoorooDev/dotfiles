This package is a meta package, collecting the components that are
widely expected to be installed for the GIT distributed version
control suite, i.e., the tool itself, the man pages, and contrib scripts.

See git-base for a minimal installation of the command-line tools.
See git-gitk for the tk-based browser gitk, no longer included in the
git meta-package.
