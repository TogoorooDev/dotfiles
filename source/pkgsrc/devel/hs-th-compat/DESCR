This package defines a Language.Haskell.TH.Syntax.Compat module, which
backports the Quote and Code types to work across a wide range of
template-haskell versions. On recent versions of template-haskell
(2.17.0.0 or later), this module simply reexports Quote and Code from
Language.Haskell.TH.Syntax. Refer to the Haddocks for
Language.Haskell.TH.Syntax.Compat for examples of how to use this
module.
