Derive Template Haskell's Lift class for datatypes using
TemplateHaskell. The functionality in this package has largely been
subsumed by the DeriveLift language extension, which is available in
GHC 8.0 and later versions. This package can still be useful as a
uniform way to derive Lift instances that is backwards-compatible with
older GHCs.
