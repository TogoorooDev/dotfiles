This package puts symlinks to libatomic in a directory specific
to libatomic, so that we can add that directory to the default
link search path of rust without also automatically picking up
other installed libraries.

This is for the benefit of our powerpc ports, where recent rust
has been changed to insist on using -latomic due to the lack of
native 64-bit atomic operations.
