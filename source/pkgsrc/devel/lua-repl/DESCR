REPL.lua provides a reusable Read-Execute-Print loop for Lua. It can be
used as alternative to the standalone interpreter included with Lua, one
that supports things like plugins, tab completion, and automatic
insertion of return in front of expressions.

It can also provide a REPL library you may embed in your application, to
provide all of the niceties of the standalone interpreter included with
Lua and then some.
