Lua-SDL2 is a portable binding of SDL2, written in pure C for efficiency.
It tries to stay as close to SDL as possible, acting as a simple binding
rather than attempting to re-design the interaction between the programmer
and SDL.

Lua-SDL2 takes full advantage of Lua's object-oriented capabilities wherever
possible, allowing the programmer to fully leverage SDL's inherent
object-oriented design.
