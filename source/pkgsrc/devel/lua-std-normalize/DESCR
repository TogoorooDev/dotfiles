This is a collection of normalized lua functions for Lua 5.1
(including LuaJIT), 5.2 and 5.3.

It can inject deterministic versions of core Lua functions that do not
behave identically across all supported Lua implementations into your
module's lexical environment.  Each function is as thin and fast a
version as is possible in each Lua implementation, evaluating to the
Lua C implementation with no overhead when semantics allow.
