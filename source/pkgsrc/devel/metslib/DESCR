METSlib is an OO (Object Oriented) metaheuristics optimization
framework in C++ designed to make easy implementing or adapting
models. The model is modular: all the implemented search algorithms
can be applied to the same model.

Once the model is implemented one can test some Tabu Search Strategies
or Simulated Annealing or other local search based search strategies.
