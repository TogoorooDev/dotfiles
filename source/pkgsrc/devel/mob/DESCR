With on-site Mob Programming, you just pass on the keyboard to hand over
to the next person. This is a challenge for a distributed team.

We hand over with WIP commits on a temporary git branch. A quick
handover is essential. At the end of the mob session, we squash the WIP
commits into expressive commits and merge into master.

We created the mob tool to simplify this process. mob notifies you when
it's time to handover. mob can moo.
