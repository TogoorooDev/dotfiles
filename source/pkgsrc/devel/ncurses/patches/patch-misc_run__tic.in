$NetBSD: patch-misc_run__tic.in,v 1.1 2020/09/07 11:11:41 schmonz Exp $

Run the built tic with the built libncurses, not the installed one, as
the build system intends (but fails) to do. This fixes "make package",
for instance, when tic needs to use a newly provided symbol.

This fix applies to fewer dynamic linkers than ${WRKSRC}/misc/shlib --
not the macOS dyld, for instance -- so making the provided script work
as intended will be more widely effective than this patch.
