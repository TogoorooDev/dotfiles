This library contains functionality for reading and writing OCaml-values in a
type-safe binary protocol. It is extremely efficient, typically supporting
type-safe marshalling and unmarshalling of even highly structured values at
speeds sufficient to saturate a gigabit connection. The protocol is also heavily
optimized for size, making it ideal for long-term storage of large amounts of
data.
