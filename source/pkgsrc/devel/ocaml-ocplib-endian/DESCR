Optimised functions to read and write int16/32/64 from strings, bytes and
bigarrays, based on primitives added in version 4.01.

The library implements three modules:

* EndianString works directly on strings, and provides submodules BigEndian and
  LittleEndian, with their unsafe counter-parts;
* EndianBytes works directly on bytes, and provides submodules BigEndian and
  LittleEndian, with their unsafe counter-parts;
* EndianBigstring works on bigstrings (Bigarrays of chars), and provides
  submodules BigEndian and LittleEndian, with their unsafe counter-parts.
