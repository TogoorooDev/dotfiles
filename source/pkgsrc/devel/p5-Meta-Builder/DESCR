Meta programming is becoming more and more popular. The popularity
of Meta programming comes from the fact that many problems are made
significantly easier. There are a few specialized Meta tools out
there, for instance Class:MOP which is used by Moose to track class
metadata.

Meta::Builder is designed to be a generic tool for writing Meta
objects. Unlike specialized tools, Meta::Builder makes no assumptions
about what metrics you will care about. Meta::Builder also makes
it simple for others to extend your meta-object based tools by
providing hooks for other packages to add metrics to your meta
object.

If a specialized Meta object tool is available to meet your needs
please use it. However if you need a simple Meta object to track
a couple metrics, use Meta::Builder.

Meta::Builder is also low-sugar and low-dep. In most cases you will
not want a class that needs a meta object to use your meta-object
class directly. Rather you will usually want to create a sugar
class that exports enhanced API functions that manipulate the meta
object.
