Perl::PrereqScanner::NotQuiteLite is yet another prerequisites scanner. It
passes almost all the scanning tests for Perl::PrereqScanner and
Module::ExtractUse (ie. except for a few dubious ones), and runs slightly faster
than PPI-based Perl::PrereqScanner. However, it doesn't run as fast as
Perl::PrereqScanner::Lite (which uses an XS lexer).
