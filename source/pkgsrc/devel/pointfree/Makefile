# "pointfree.cabal" declares an empty library (exposing no symbols at
# all), and the executable doesn't depend on the library either. This
# is not only pointless, but also makes Cabal do a weird thing
# possibly due to a bug: it embeds an rpath to the *build directory*
# which serves absolutely no purpose. Disable the library as a
# workaround.
