The aiounittest is a helper library to ease of your pain (and boilerplate),
when writing a test of the asynchronous code (asyncio). You can test:
* synchronous code (same as the unittest.TestCase)
* asynchronous code, it supports syntax with async/await (Python 3.5+) and
  asyncio.coroutine/yield from (Python 3.4)
