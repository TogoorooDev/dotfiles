AnyIO is a asynchronous compatibility API that allows applications and
libraries written against it to run unmodified on asyncio, curio and trio.

It bridges the following functionality:
* Task groups
* Cancellation
* Threads
* Signal handling
* Asynchronous file I/O
* Synchronization primitives (locks, conditions, events, semaphores, queues)
* High level networking (TCP, UDP and UNIX sockets)
