The aim of this module is to provide a common base representation of Python
source code. It is currently the library powering pylint's capabilities.

It provides a compatible representation which comes from the _ast module. It
rebuilds the tree generated by the builtin _ast module by recursively walking
down the AST and building an extended ast. The new node classes have additional
methods and attributes for different usages. They include some support for
static inference and local name scopes. Furthermore, astroid can also build
partial trees by inspecting living objects.
