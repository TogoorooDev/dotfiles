This package contains a copy of Google's i18n address metadata
repository that contains great data but comes with no uptime
guarantees.

Contents of this package will allow you to programatically build
address forms that adhere to rules of a particular region or country,
validate local addresses and format them to produce a valid address
label for delivery.

The package also contains a Python interface for address validation.
