importlib_metadata is a library which provides an API for accessing an
installed package's metadata, such as its entry points or its top-level name.
This functionality intends to replace most uses of pkg_resources entry point
API and metadata API. Along with importlib.resources in Python 3.7 and newer
(backported as importlib_resources for older versions of Python), this can
eliminate the need to use the older and less efficient pkg_resources package.

importlib_metadata is a backport of Python 3.8's standard library
importlib.metadata module for Python 2.7, and 3.4 through 3.7. Users of Python
3.8 and beyond are encouraged to use the standard library module, and in fact
for these versions, importlib_metadata just shadows that module. Developers
looking for detailed API descriptions should refer to the Python 3.8 standard
library documentation.
