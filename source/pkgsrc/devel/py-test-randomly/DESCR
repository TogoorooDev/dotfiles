Pytest plugin to randomly order tests and control random.seed.

* Randomly shuffles the order of test items. This is done first at the level of
  modules, then at the level of test classes (if you have them), then at the
  order of functions. This also works with things like doctests.
* Resets random.seed() at the start of every test case and test to a fixed
  number - this defaults to time.time() from the start of your test run, but
  you can pass in --randomly-seed to repeat a randomness-induced failure.
* If factory boy is installed, its random state is reset at the start of every
  test. This allows for repeatable use of its random 'fuzzy' features.
* If faker is installed, its random state is reset at the start of every test.
  This is also for repeatable fuzzy data in tests - factory boy uses faker for
  lots of data.
