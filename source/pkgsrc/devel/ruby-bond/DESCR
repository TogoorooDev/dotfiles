Bond is on a mission to improve autocompletion in ruby, especially
for irb/ripl. Aside from doing everything irb's can do and fixing
its quirks, Bond can autocomplete argument(s) to methods, uniquely
completing per module, per method and per argument. Bond brings
ruby autocompletion closer to bash/zsh as it provides a configuration
system and a DSL for creating custom completions and completion
rules. With this configuration system, users can customize their
autocompletions and share it with others. Bond can also load
completions that ship with gems. Bond is able to offer more than
irb's completion since it uses the full line of input when completing
as opposed to irb's last-word approach.
