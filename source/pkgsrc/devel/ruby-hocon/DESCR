ruby-hocon
==========

This is a port of the [Typesafe Config](https://github.com/typesafehub/config)
library to Ruby.

The library provides Ruby support for the
[HOCON](https://github.com/typesafehub/config/blob/master/HOCON.md)
configuration file format.


At present, it supports parsing and modification of existing HOCON/JSON files
via the `ConfigFactory` class and the `ConfigValueFactory` class, and
rendering parsed config objects back to a String ([see examples
below](#basic-usage)).  It also supports the parsing and modification of
HOCON/JSON files via `ConfigDocumentFactory`.

**Note:** While the project is production ready, since not all features in the
Typesafe library are supported, you may still run into some issues. If you
find a problem, feel free to open a github issue.

The implementation is intended to be as close to a line-for-line port as the
two languages allow, in hopes of making it fairly easy to port over new
changesets from the Java code base over time.
