ugdb is an unsegen based alternative TUI for gdb.
The interface consists of 4 containers between which the user can switch with
vim-like controls: To enter selection mode, press ESC (indicated by orange
separators). You can then navigate between containers using arrow keys or hjkl.
Press Enter to enter insert-mode and interact with the selected container.
Alternatively press the shortcut key for the specific container to directly
enter it from selection mode.
