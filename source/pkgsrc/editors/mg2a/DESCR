Mg (mg) is a Public Domain EMACS style editor.  It is "broadly"
compatible with GNU Emacs.  Mg was formerly named MicroGnuEmacs,
but is not associated with the GNU project.

This program is intended to be a small, fast, and portable editor for
people who can't (or don't want to) run real Emacs.

The NetBSD version has a few minor cosmetic changes, better locating
of the startup file (mg.rc), journaling and original mirroring of
files.
