HAXM is a cross-platform hardware-assisted virtualization engine (hypervisor),
widely used as an accelerator for Android Emulator and QEMU. It has always
supported running on Windows and macOS, and has been ported to other host
operating systems as well, such as Linux and NetBSD.

HAXM runs as a kernel-mode driver on the host operating system, and provides a
KVM-like interface to user space, thereby enabling applications like QEMU to
utilize the hardware virtualization capabilities built into modern Intel CPUs,
namely Intel Virtualization Technology.
