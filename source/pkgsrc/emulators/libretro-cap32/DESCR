Libretro is a simple but powerful development interface that allows for
the easy creation of emulators, games and multimedia applications that
can plug straight into any libretro-compatible frontend. This development
interface is open to others so that they can run these pluggable emulator
and game cores also in their own programs or devices.

Caprice32 is a software emulator of the Amstrad CPC 8-bit home computer
series. The emulator faithfully imitates the CPC464, CPC664, and CPC6128
models. By recreating the operations of all hardware components at a
low level, the emulator achieves a high degree of compatibility with
original CPC software. These programs or games can be run unmodified at
real-time or higher speeds, depending on the emulator host environment.

It is recommended that users enable "autorun" in the Core Options in
the RetroArch F1 menu after selecting a disk image for the first time,
then restart the core to load it.

A virtual keyboard can be toggled by pressing the virtual "Y" button.
