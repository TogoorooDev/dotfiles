Libretro is a simple but powerful development interface that allows for the
easy creation of emulators, games and multimedia applications that can plug
straight into any libretro-compatible frontend. This development interface is
open to others so that they can run these pluggable emulator and game cores
also in their own programs or devices.

FinalBurn Neo is an emulator for arcade games and select consoles.

It is based on the emulators FinalBurn and old versions of MAME.  Many of
the developers of this project also worked on FB Alpha. Due to a controversy,
we no longer do, and recommend that everyone use this emulator instead.
