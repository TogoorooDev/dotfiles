Libretro is a simple but powerful development interface that allows for
the easy creation of emulators, games and multimedia applications that
can plug straight into any libretro-compatible frontend. This development
interface is open to others so that they can run these pluggable emulator
and game cores also in their own programs or devices.

MAME is the Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator. This is a port of MAME
0.139 to libretro with backported improvements and is compatible with
MAME 0.139 romsets.
