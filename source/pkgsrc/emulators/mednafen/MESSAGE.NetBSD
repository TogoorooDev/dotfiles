Mednafen expects a very low audio latency.  Unless you lower the audio
latency or blk_ms to <5ms with sysctl(8), it will print the following
warning:

"Warning: Period time is too large(it should be <= ~5.333ms).
Video will appear very jerky."

Slightly higher latency levels may be acceptable depending on the
emulation target and personal preferences.
