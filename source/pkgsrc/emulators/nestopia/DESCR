Nestopia is a portable and cycle-accurate open-source Nintendo
Entertainment System/Famicom emulator designed to emulate the NES
hardware as accurately as possible.

This is Nestopia UE. Nestopia UE (Undead Edition) is a fork of the
original source code, with enhancements from members of the emulation
community. This includes support for new platforms, and bug fixes
in the emulator core.
