UnifrakturMaguntia has been created by j. 'mach' wust, Gerrit Ansmann and Georg
Duffner. It is a modification of Peter Wiegel's font Berthold Mainzer Fraktur,
is in turn based on a 1901 typeface by Carl Albert Fahrenwaldt.

UnifrakturMaguntia has been created in order to provide a Fraktur typeface that
may be embedded on websites. It is in accordance with the Unicode standard. It
has suitable font licenses (GPL with font exception and OFL).

By now, Gerrit Ansmann has redrawn all of Wiegel's original letters up to the
very last special character.
