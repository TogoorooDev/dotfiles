BabelStone Tibetan is a Unicode Tibetan font.  It is a modification
and extension of the Jomolhari font.  Jomolhari is a Bhutanese style
calligraphic uchen Tibetan script font.

BabelStone Tibetan is based on Jomolhari Version alpha 0.003c 2006,
which is quite old, and so does not include sixteen characters added
to the Tibetan block in Unicode versions 5.1 (2008), 5.2 (2009) and
6.0 (2010).  BabelStone Tibetan adds support for these sixteen
characters, and also extends the font to cover many additional stack
clusters, including non-standard clusters that are used for writing
Tibetan shorthand contractions and some unusual clusters that were
used for transcribing Tangut.

BabelStone Tibetan has an extremely large line height in order to
allow for very high and deep stacks found in some religious texts.
BabelStone Tibetan Slim is almost exactly the same as BabelStone
Tibetan, but has a small line height; it is suitable for ordinary
modern Tibetan text, but some stacks for Sanskrit may be cropped at
the top and/or bottom.
