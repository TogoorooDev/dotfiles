Inconsolata is a humanist monospace font designed for source code listings,
terminal emulators, and similar uses. It was influenced by the proprietary
Consolas monospace font, designed by Lucas de Groot, the proportional Avenir
and IBM's classic monospace Letter Gothic.

Inconsolata has received favorable reviews from many programmers who consider
it to be a highly readable and clear monospace font.
