This package enables users to declare in their document which
physical fonts should be used for the standard Japanese
(logical) fonts of pLaTeX and upLaTeX. Font setup is realized
by changing the font mapping of dvipdfmx, and thus users can
use any (monospaced) physical fonts they like, once they
properly install this package, without creating helper files
for each new font. This package also supports setup for the
fonts used in the japanese-otf package. System requirements:
TeX format: LaTeX. TeX engine: pTeX or upTeX. DVIware:
dvipdfmx. Prerequisite packages: atbegshi.
