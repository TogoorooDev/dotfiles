This package changes the setup of the japanese-otf package so
that the TFMs for direct input are all replaced by new ones
with prefixed names; for example, nmlminr-h will be replaced by
foo--nmlminr-h, where foo is a prefix specified by the user.
This function will assist users who want to use the
japanese-otf package together with tailored TFMs of Japanese
fonts. The "jodel" part of the package name stands for
"japanese-otf deluxe". Here "deluxe" is the name of
japanese-otf's option for employing multi-weight Japanese font
families. This option is probably the most likely reason for
using japanese-otf. So pxjodel is really about japanese-otf's
"deluxe" option, hence the name. It is not related to yodel
singing, although some sense of word-play is intended.
