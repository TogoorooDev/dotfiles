A color and B&W emoji SVGinOT font built from the Twitter Emoji
for Everyone artwork with support for ZWJ, skin tone diversity and
country flags.

The font works in all operating systems, but will currently only
show color emoji in Firefox and Thunderbird. This is not a limitation
of the font, but of the operating systems and applications. Regular
B&W outline emoji are included for backwards/fallback compatibility.
