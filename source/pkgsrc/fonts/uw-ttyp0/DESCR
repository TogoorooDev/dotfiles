UW ttyp0 is a family of bitmap programmer's fonts in bdf format. It covers
most of the Latin and Cyrillic alphabet, Greek, Armenian, Georgian (only
Mkhedruli), Hebrew (without cantillation marks), Thai, most of IPA (but no
UPA), standard punctuation, common symbols, some mathematics, line graphics,
a few dingbats, and Powerline delimiter symbols.

UW ttyp0 comes in nine sizes from 6x11 to 11x22. In all of the sizes there
are regular and bold versions; for some there is also a (somewhat experimental)
italic.
