You will need the original files of the PC (DOS or CD) or Amiga release.

To have background music during polygonal cutscenes with the PC version,
you need to copy the music/ directory of the Amiga version or use the .mod
fileset from unexotica.

To hear voice during in-game dialogues, you'll need to copy the 'VOICE.VCE'
file from the SegaCD version to the DATA directory.
