Cross-platform port of the indie game l'Abbaye des Morts.

In the 13th century, the Cathars, clerics who preached about the poverty of
Christ and defended life without material aspirations, were treated as
heretics by the Catholic Church and expelled out of the Languedoc region in
France. One of them, called Jean Raymond, found an old church in which to
hide from crusaders, not knowing that beneath its ruins lay buried an ancient
evil.

l'Abbaye des Morts has been inspired by the tragic history of the Cathars
and platform games for ZX Spectrum computers like Manic Miner, Jet Set Willy
or Dynamite Dan.

Faith will be your only weapon in this platformer styled like a ZX Spectrum
game. Black backgrounds, 1 color sprites and 1 bit sounds are a proper fit
for a raw story. The lack of details turn on the player's imagination,
creating a unique experience for each player.
