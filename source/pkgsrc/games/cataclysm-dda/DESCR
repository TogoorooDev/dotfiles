Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead is a turn-based survival game set in a
post-apocalyptic world.

Struggle to survive in a harsh, persistent, procedurally generated world.

Scavenge the remnants of a dead civilization for food, equipment, or, if
you are lucky, a vehicle with a full tank of gas to get you the hell out of
Dodge.

Fight to defeat or escape from a wide variety of powerful monstrosities,
from zombies to giant insects to killer robots and things far stranger and
deadlier, and against the others like yourself, that want what you have...
