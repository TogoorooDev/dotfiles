Chocolate Doom aims to accurately reproduce the original DOS version of
Doom and other games based on the Doom engine in a form that can be
run on modern computers.

Originally, Chocolate Doom was only a Doom source port. The project
now includes ports of Heretic and Hexen, and Strife.

Chocolate Doom's aims are:

 * To always be 100% Free and Open Source software.
 * Portability to as many different operating systems as possible.
 * Accurate reproduction of the original DOS versions of the games,
   including bugs.
 * Compatibility with the DOS demo, configuration and savegame files.
 * To provide an accurate retro "feel" (display and input should
   behave the same).

This is a game engine - the data files are not included.
