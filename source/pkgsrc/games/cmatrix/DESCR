CMatrix is based on the screensaver from The Matrix website. It
shows text flying in and out in a terminal like as seen in "The
Matrix" movie. It can scroll lines all at the same rate or
asynchronously and at a user-defined speed.

CMatrix by default operates in eye candy mode. It must be aborted
with control-c (Ctrl+C) or by pressing q. If you wish for more of
a screen saver effect, you must specify -s on the command line.
For usage info, use cmatrix -h.
