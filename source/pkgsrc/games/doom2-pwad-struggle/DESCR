Attention: This is a mod for Doom II, not a standalone game!
It has received one of the 2018 Cacowards on Doomworld.

For the look & feel intended by the author, you need the original Doom II
from id Software as base (doom2.wad as IWAD).
If you don't have Doom II, you can use Freedoom (freedoom2.wad as IWAD) to
play, but the Freedoom graphics doesn't match well to the style of this mod.

===========================================================================
Advanced engine needed  : Limit removing compatibility
                          This wad uses heavily modified DeHacked patch. So
                          it is recommended not to use other custom gameplay
                          patches.
Primary purpose         : Single player
===========================================================================

Struggle - Antaresian Legacy
It features new weapons and monsters replacement with DeHacked patch.
Some of original monsters are also slightly changed, so it's recommended to
check out the info [see installed text file], before you play this one.

P.S.: Par time is based on UV-MAX, not UV-Speed
P.P.S. : Please try STRG_M28.wad file, if you're having a framerate issue
         with MAP28.
