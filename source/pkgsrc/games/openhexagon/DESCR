             "You are a triangle."

Fast paced, challenging, free to play, open source game.

You control a little triangle, which can be rotated clockwise or
counterclockwise. Your goal is to suvive as long as possible by
dodging polygons that move towards the center. Things get more
difficult as time passes!

Features a lot of variety and full customization: users can
create/modify/share levels, patterns, music, sounds, scripts,
and more.

Play in Official Mode and submit your highscores to the
server. Be the first in the leaderboards!
