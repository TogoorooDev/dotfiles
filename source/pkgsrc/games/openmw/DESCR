OpenMW is a free, open source and modern game engine which reimplements and
extends the one that runs the 2002 open-world RPG Morrowind. The engine
comes with its own editor, called OpenMW-CS which allows the user to edit
or create their own original games.

NOTE: Playing Morrowind with this engine still requires the Morrowind data
files that you own.
