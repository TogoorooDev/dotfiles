oshu! is a clone of osu!

osu! is that PC clone of the osu! Tatakae! Ouendan DS rhythm game,
occidentalized as Elite Beat Agents.

This project was born out of frustration from not being able to
play osu! on a little Linux box with no graphics card whatsoever.
It's aimed at minimalistic people and probably will never contain
a hundredth of the official client's features.
