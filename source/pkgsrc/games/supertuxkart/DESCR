SuperTuxKart is a 3D open-source arcade racer with a variety
characters, tracks, and modes to play. Our aim is to create a game
that is more fun than realistic, and provide an enjoyable experience
for all ages.

In Story mode, you must face the evil Nolok, and defeat him in
order to make the Mascot Kingdom safe once again! You can race by
yourself against the computer, compete in several Grand Prix cups,
or try to beat your fastest time in Time Trial mode. You can also
race or battle with up to eight friends on a single computer, play
on a local network or play online with other players all over the
world.
