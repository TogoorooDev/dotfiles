Valyria Tear is an open-source single-player medieval-fantasy 2D J-RPG based
on an extended Hero of Allacrost engine and inspired by classic console
RPGs.

The player incarnates Bronann, a young boy forced to take part into the
struggle for the possession of a mysterious crystal. This powerful artifact
will lead him to discover the actual threat set upon his world, but also
courage and love.

The game has all the features you can expect from JRPG classics: entertaining
story development, colourful map exploration, active side-view battles,
character management, puzzles... It is also translated in several languages.
