$NetBSD: patch-ad,v 1.6 2019/05/02 19:01:17 gdt Exp $

This patch was rejected by upstream.  There is a comment in upstream
Makefile.in that explains why there is no space, and output flag is
set to "-o ", so that the output flag can be set to "-Fo" for MSVC.

On NetBSD, the upstream version works, but there is some mysterious
failure on Mac OS X.  This patch therefore needs investigation and
resolution to be filed with upstream.  (It almost certainly breaks
native compilation on Windows, but that's not a pkgsrc platform.)
