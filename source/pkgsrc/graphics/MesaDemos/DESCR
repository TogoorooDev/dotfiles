The Mesa project is as an open-source implementation of the OpenGL
specification - a system for rendering interactive 3D graphics.

This package provides examples and demos of Mesa's capabilities, among
them the examples from the ``Red Book'' (_OpenGL Programming Guide_,
published by Addison-Wesley; ISBN 0-201-63274-8).
