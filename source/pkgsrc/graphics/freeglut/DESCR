FreeGLUT is a free-software/open-source alternative to the OpenGL Utility
Toolkit (GLUT) library.

GLUT (and hence FreeGLUT) takes care of all the system-specific chores
required for creating windows, initializing OpenGL contexts, and handling
input events, to allow for trully portable OpenGL programs.
