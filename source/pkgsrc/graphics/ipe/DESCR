Ipe is a drawing editor for creating figures in PDF or (encapsulated)
Postscript format. It supports making small figures for inclusion
into LaTeX-documents as well as making multi-page PDF presentations
that can be shown on-line with Acrobat Reader.

Ipe's main features are:

 *  Entry of text as LaTeX source code. This makes it easy to enter
    mathematical expressions, and to reuse the LaTeX-macros of the
    main document. In the display text is displayed as it will
    appear in the figure.
 *  Produces pure Postscript/PDF, including the text. Ipe converts
    the LaTeX-source to PDF or Postscript when the file is saved.
 *  It is easy to align objects with respect to each other (for
    instance, to place a point on the intersection of two lines,
    or to draw a circle through three given points) using various
    snapping modes.
 *  Users can provide ipelets (Ipe plug-ins) to add functionality
    to Ipe. This way, Ipe can be extended for each task at hand.
 *  The text model is based on Unicode, and has been tested with
    Korean, Chinese, and Japanese.
