This package contains C software to implement JPEG image encoding,
decoding, and transcoding written by the Independent JPEG Group.
JPEG is a standardized compression method for full-color and
gray-scale images.

The distributed programs provide conversion between JPEG "JFIF"
format and image files in PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, GIF, BMP, and Targa file
formats.  The core compression and decompression library can easily
be reused in other programs, such as image viewers.  The package
is highly portable C code.
