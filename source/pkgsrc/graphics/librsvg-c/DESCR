librsvg is Raph's scalable vector graphics library.  It provides support for
SVG graphics, and is used by the GNOME desktop.

This package provides the librsvg library as well as some addons -- a pixbuf
loader and a theme engine -- for the GTK+ toolkit.

This package provides the older 2.40.x branch of librsvg that is written
in plain C.
