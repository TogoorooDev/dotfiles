Like ls, but for images. Shows thumbnails in terminal using sixel graphics.

Just typing lsix will show images in the current working directory.
You can also specify filenames and, of course, use shell wild cards.
Because lsix uses ImageMagick pretty much any image format will be supported.
However, some may be slow to render (like PDF), so lsix doesn't show them
unless you ask specifically.
