This MetaPost library was initially written to automate some
elements of black and white illustrations for a physics
textbook. It provides functions to draw things like lines of
variable width, shaded spheres, and tubes of different kinds,
which can be used to produce images of a variety of objects.
The library also contains functions to draw some objects
constructed from these primitives.
