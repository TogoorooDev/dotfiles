SoapySDR is an open-source generalized API and runtime library for interfacing
with SDR devices. With SoapySDR, you can instantiate, configure, and stream
with an SDR device in a variety of environments. Most off the shelf
SDR hardware platforms are supported by SoapySDR, and many open source
applications rely on SoapySDR for hardware integration support. In addition,
SoapySDR has bindings for development frameworks like GNU Radio and Pothos.
