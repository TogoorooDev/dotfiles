This is a meta package providing the latest release of the Go
programming language that is available for the host system.

The actual Go programming language is provided by packages such as
lang/go111, lang/go110, etc.  This package merely allows users to
install "go" instead of having to figure out the exact package name.

No package should depend on this package directly.
