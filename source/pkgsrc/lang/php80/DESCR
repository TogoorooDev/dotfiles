PHP is a widely-used open source general-purpose scripting language
that is especially suited for web development and can be embedded
into HTML.  It is modular, and object-oriented.  Much of its syntax
is borrowed from C, Java and Perl with a couple of unique PHP-specific
features thrown in.  The language is designed to allow web developers
to write dynamically generated pages quickly.

PHP 8.0 comes with numerous improvements and new features such as

* Union Types
* Named Arguments
* Match Expressions
* Attributes
* Constructor Property Promotion
* Nullsafe Operator
* Weak Maps
* Just In Time Compilation
* And much much more...
