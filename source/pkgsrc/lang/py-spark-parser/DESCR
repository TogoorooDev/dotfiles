This package uses Jay Earley's algorithm for parsing context free grammars, and
comes with some generic Abstract Syntax Tree routines. There is also a
prototype scanner which does its job by combining Python regular expressions.

(SPARK stands for Scanning, Parsing, and Rewriting Kit. It is a poor name since
it conflicts with a more popular package of the same name. In the future we
will rename this.)
