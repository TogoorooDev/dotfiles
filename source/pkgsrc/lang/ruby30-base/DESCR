Ruby is the interpreted scripting language for quick and easy Object
Oriented Programming.  It has many features to process text files and to do
system management tasks (as in Perl).  It is simple, straight-forward, and
extensible.

Features of Ruby are shown below.

  + Simple Syntax
  + *Normal* Object-Oriented features (ex. class, method calls)
  + *Advanced* Object-Oriented features (ex. Mix-in, Singleton-method)
  + Operator Overloading
  + Exception Handling
  + Iterators and Closures
  + Garbage Collection
  + Dynamic Loading of Object files (on some architecture)
  + Highly Portable (works on many UNIX machines, and on DOS, Windows,
    Mac, etc.)
