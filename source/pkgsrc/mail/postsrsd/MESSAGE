When using postsrsd with its rc.d script, at the minimum set
postsrsd_flags="-dyour.domain"
in rc.conf. See the manpage for more options.

You must store at least one secret key in ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/postsrsd.secret.
Be careful that no one can guess your secret, because anyone who knows it
can use your mail server as open relay.
Each line of ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/postsrsd.secret is used as secret.
The first secret is used for signing and verification, the others for
verification only.

PostSRSd exposes its functionality via two TCP lookup tables.
Add or amend the following variables in your main.cf:

    sender_canonical_maps = tcp:localhost:10001
    sender_canonical_classes = envelope_sender
    recipient_canonical_maps = tcp:localhost:10002
    recipient_canonical_classes= envelope_recipient,header_recipient

This will transparently rewrite incoming and outgoing envelope addresses,
and additionally undo SRS rewrites in the To: header of bounce notifications
and vacation autoreplies.
