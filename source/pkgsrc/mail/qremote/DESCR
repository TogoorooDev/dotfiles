qremote is an experimental drop-in replacement for qmail's qmail-remote
with CurveCP support.

qmail-qremote resolves IP addresses for SMTP server and then calls
either tcpclient or qmail-curvecpclient for TCP or CurveCP connections,
respectively. Once the connection is established, qmail-rsmtp executes
to send mail via SMTP.
