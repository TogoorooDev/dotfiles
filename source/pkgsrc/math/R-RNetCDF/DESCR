An R interface to the NetCDF file format designed by Unidata for
efficient storage of array-oriented scientific data and descriptions.
The R interface is closely based on the C API of the NetCDF library,
and it includes calendar conversions from the Unidata UDUNITS library.
The current implementation supports all operations on NetCDF datasets
in classic and 64-bit offset file formats, and NetCDF4-classic format
is supported for reading and modification of existing files.
