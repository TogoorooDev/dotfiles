The library contains implementations of several lattice algorithms.
The implementation relies of floating-point orthogonalization, and
LLL is central to the code, hence the name.

Other algorithms provided by the library include

 - BKZ/BKZ-2.0 with support of slide reduction and self dual BKZ.
 - Kannan-Fincke-Pohst algorithm that finds the shortest non-zero
   lattic vector.
 - GaussSieve algorithm for the same problem as above.
