MPFI (Multiple Precision Floating-Point Interval Library) is a library
for arbitrary precision interval arithmetic with intervals represented
using MPFR reliable floating-point numbers. It is based on the GNU MP
library and on the MPFR library. The purpose of an arbitrary precision
interval arithmetic is on the one hand to get guaranteed results,
thanks to interval computation, and on the other hand to obtain
accurate results, thanks to multiple precision arithmetic. The MPFI
library is built upon MPFR to benefit from the correct roundings
provided by MPFR, it portability, and its compliance with the IEEE 754
standard for floating-point arithmetic.
