NumPy is a general-purpose array-processing package designed to
efficiently manipulate large multi-dimensional arrays of arbitrary
records without sacrificing too much speed for small multi-dimensional
arrays.  NumPy is built on the Numeric code base and adds features
introduced by numarray as well as an extended C-API and the ability to
create arrays of arbitrary type.

There are also basic facilities for discrete fourier transform,
basic linear algebra and random number generation.

This is an old version that still supports Python 2.7, kept because it
is required dependency of other packages that still require Python 2.7.
