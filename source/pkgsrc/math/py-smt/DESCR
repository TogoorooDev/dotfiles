pySMT is a solver-agnostic library for SMT Formulae manipulation and
solving.

pySMT makes working with Satisfiability Modulo Theory simple:

- Define formulae in a simple, intuitive, and solver independent way

- Solve your formulae using one of the native solvers, or by wrapping
  any SMT-Lib compliant solver,

- Dump your problems in the SMT-Lib format,

- and more...
