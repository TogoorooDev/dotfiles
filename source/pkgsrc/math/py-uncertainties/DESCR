uncertainties allows calculations such as (2 +/- 0.1)*2 = 4 +/- 0.2 to be
performed transparently. Much more complex mathematical expressions involving
numbers with uncertainties can also be evaluated directly.

The uncertainties package takes the pain and complexity out of uncertainty
calculations.
