This library contains a database of MIME types that maps filename extensions
into MIME types suitable for use in many Internet protocols such as HTTP or
e-mail. It is generated from the mime.types file found in Unix systems, but has
no dependency on a filesystem since it includes the contents of the database as
an ML datastructure.
