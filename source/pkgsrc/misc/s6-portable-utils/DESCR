s6-portable-utils is a set of tiny general Unix utilities, often performing
well-known tasks such as cut and grep, but optimized for simplicity and
small size. They were designed for embedded systems and other constrained
environments, but they work everywhere.

Other set of small utilities are usually system-specific; for instance, the
(otherwise excellent) BusyBox project only works on Linux.
