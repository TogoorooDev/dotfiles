 0 Developer's guide to buildlink3
 =================================

This is a tutorial for pkgsrc developers to understand and to use the
buildlink3 framework in pkgsrc.  The buildlink3 framework establishes the
principle: only allow the software build process to see what we choose to
allow it to see.


 1 libtool
 ==============================

The buildlink3 framework handles packages that install libtool archive
files for libraries that are also present in the base system.  It more
tightly controls where libtool can find libtool archives.  This reduces
the number of conflicts between libtool libraries provided by the base
system and those from pkgsrc.


 2 buildlink3.mk file structure
 ==============================

The buildlink3.mk files keep track of how "deep" we are in including
buildlink3.mk files, and only create dependencies on packages encountered
at depth 1.  This means that packages that want to add a dependency must
directly include the buildlink3.mk file for that dependency.


 3 Troubleshooting
 =================

Q1: Where can I see the actual command executed by the wrapper
    scripts?

A1: You should examine the contents of the ${WRKDIR}/.work.log file.
    The lines preceded with [*] are the commands that are intercepted
    by the wrapper scripts, and the lines preceded with <.> are the
    commands that are executed by the wrapper scripts.


Q2: Why can't I check the values of variables set by the buildlink3
    framework using 'make show-var VARNAME=...'?

A2: Some variables are only defined for a subset of the package build
    phases.  Try instead:

	make show-var PKG_PHASE=wrapper VARNAME=...
